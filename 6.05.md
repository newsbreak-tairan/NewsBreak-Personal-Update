## 1 - Why NoSQL
For RDBMS, it is difficult to manage massive amount of data, impacting database performance and scalability. Therefore, when dealing with tremendous data, NoSQL might be a better choice.

## 2 - Procedures of ap in spider-upstream

## 3 - Immigrating partial functions from spider/upstream to mp-rss-ingestion
Task: immigrate functions of ap.go & wholesaler.go in spider/upstream to mp-rss-ingestion.

## 4 - Have a Perliminary Understanding of how mp-rss-ingestion implemented

## 5 - Kubernetes (K8s)
K8s is an open-source container orchestration platform. It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

A k8s cluster is a set of machines (nodes) used to run containerized applications. There are two important components in a k8s cluster:
- Control plane: responsible for managing the states of a cluster, which normally run on multiple nodes that span across several data centers.
- A set of worker nodes: they are responsible for running the containerized application workloads. Containerized applications run in a Pod, **the smallest deployable unit** in K8s holding one or more containers with shared storage and network. 

### 5.1 - Control Plane
A control plane possesses several core components:
1. API server: the primary interface between the control plan & the rest of the cluster.
2. etcd: a distributed key-value store, storing the cluster's persistent state.
3. scheduler: responsible for scheduling pods onto the worker nodes in the cluster. It uses information about _the resources required by the pods_ & _the available resources on the worker nodes to achieve load-balancing.
4. controller manager: responsible for running controllers that managing the state of the cluster.

### 5.2 - Worker Nodes
The core component of a worker nodes include:
1. kubelet: each worker node has a kubelet running on it, which is responsible for communicating with the control plane.
2. container runtime: responsible for pulling the container images from a registry, starting & stopping th containers, and managing the containers' resources.
3. kube-proxy: is a networking proxy running on each node, responsible for routing traffic to the correct pods. It also provides load-balancing for the pods, ensuring that traffic is distributed evenly across the pods.

### 5.3 - Tradeoffs
- Pros:
  - Scalable & highly available
  - Highly portable
- Cons:
  - High complexity
  - Cost

## 6 - Kafka
### 6.1 - KafkaProducer
Kafka producer is used to create a kafka producer responsible for sending message to kafka topics.
- `__init__(**configs)`: initializes the Kafka producer, accepting configuration arguments like `bootstrap_servers`
- `send(topic, value=None, key=None, partition=None, timestamp_ms=None, headers=None)`: Sends a message to the specified topic.
- `flush(timeout = None)`: sends all accumulated messages in memory to kafka.
- `close(timeout = None)`: closes the producer.

### 6.2 - KafkaConsumer
The KafkaConsumer class is used to create a Kafka consumer, responsible for fetching messages from Kafka topics.
- `__init__(**configs)`: similar
- `poll(timeout_ms=100, max_records=None)`: fetches messages from Kafka topics.
- `commit()`: manually commits the customer's offsets.
- `close(timeout=None)`: closes the consumer.

### 6.3 - KafkaAdminClient
The KafkaAdminClient class is used for managing the Kafka cluster, providing functionalities such as creating and deleting topics, increasing or decreasing partitions, etc.
- `__init__(**configs)`: similar
- `create_topics(new_topics, **configs)`: creates new topics.
- `delete_topics(topics, **configs)`: deletes specified topics.
- `list_topics`: lists all topics.

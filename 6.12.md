## 1 - Why are pipelines and other settings written here instead of the configuration file?

In the Scrapy framework, `custom_settings` is used to override global settings specifically for a particular Spider. This is done for several reasons:

1. **Flexibility**: Different Spiders may require different configurations. For example, one Spider might need a different Item Pipeline or a different concurrency level compared to another. Using `custom_settings` allows you to easily customize settings for each Spider without modifying the global `settings.py` file.

2. **Modularity**: Keeping settings with the Spider's logic makes the code easier to manage and understand. Developers can see all relevant configurations for a Spider in one place, rather than having to look through multiple files.

3. **Avoiding Global Impact**: Settings in the global `settings.py` file affect all Spiders. If you need specific configurations for just one or a few Spiders, using `custom_settings` is a better approach.

### 1.1 - Can the Scrapy framework manage data passing, etc., through these settings?

Yes, the Scrapy framework fully supports managing various configurations, including data passing, concurrency control, download delays, pipelines, etc., through the `custom_settings` in the Spider class. These settings will override the corresponding global settings for that specific Spider.

### 1.2 - Common Configuration Options in `custom_settings`

Some common options you might set in `custom_settings` include:

- **ITEM_PIPELINES**: Defines the Item Pipeline and their order.
- **CONCURRENT_ITEMS**: The maximum number of items to process concurrently.
- **CONCURRENT_REQUESTS**: The maximum number of concurrent requests the Scrapy downloader should be allowed.
- **CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN**: The maximum number of concurrent requests allowed per domain.
- **DOWNLOAD_DELAY**: The delay between requests to the same website.
- **DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT**: The download timeout period.

### 1.3 - Example

`custom_settings` overrides several key configurations:

```python
custom_settings = {
    'ITEM_PIPELINES': {
        'scheduled_ingest.utils.updater_pipline.UpdaterPipline': 40,
        'scheduled_ingest.utils.pipelines.DownstreamWriter': 80,
    },
    'CONCURRENT_ITEMS': 1024 * 10,
    'CONCURRENT_REQUESTS': 1024,
    'CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN': 1024,
    'DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT': 180
}
```

These settings will be effective for this particular Spider, without affecting other Spiders or the global settings. For example:

- **ITEM_PIPELINES**: Defines two Item Pipelines with their priority levels.
- **CONCURRENT_ITEMS**, **CONCURRENT_REQUESTS**, **CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN**: Sets a high level of concurrency.
- **DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT**: Sets a longer download timeout.

In summary, `custom_settings` provides a flexible way to customize settings for different Spiders, making project management more efficient and clearer.

## 2 - @dataclass
In Python, the `@dataclass` decorator is used to **simplify** class definitions, especially those primarily intended to **store data**. By using `@dataclass`, Python automatically generates special methods like `__init__`, `__repr__`, `__eq__`, etc., which reduces the need to write these methods manually.

### 2.1 - Basic Usage

First, import the `dataclass` from the `dataclasses` module:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
```

Then, use the `@dataclass` decorator to define a data class. For example:

```python
@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str
    age: int
```

This simple definition automatically generates the following methods for the `Person` class:

- `__init__(self, name: str, age: int)`
- `__repr__(self)`
- `__eq__(self, other)`

### 2.2 - Generated Code Example

Continuing from the above example, let's create a `Person` object:

```python
p1 = Person(name="Alice", age=30)
```

The automatically generated `__init__` method will look something like this:

```python
def __init__(self, name: str, age: int):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
```

You can then access the attributes just like in any regular class:

```python
print(p1.name)  # Output: Alice
print(p1.age)   # Output: 30
```

### 2.3 - Default Field Values

You can specify default values for fields:

```python
@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str
    age: int = 0  # Default value is 0
```

Now, if you create an instance without providing the `age`, it defaults to 0:

```python
p2 = Person(name="Bob")
print(p2.age)  # Output: 0
```

### 2.4 - Optional Field Types

For **optional** fields, you can use `Optional` from the `typing` module:

```python
from typing import Optional

@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str
    age: Optional[int] = None
```

### 2.5 - Fields Excluded from Comparison

You can use the `field` function to specify that some fields should be excluded from certain generated methods, such as comparisons:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field

@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str
    age: int
    id: int = field(compare=False)
```

In this example, the `id` field will not be used in the `__eq__` method.

### 2.6 - Mutable Default Values

For fields with mutable default values (like lists or dictionaries), use `field` with `default_factory` to avoid shared default values:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field

@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str
    hobbies: list = field(default_factory=list)
```

This ensures that each `Person` object has its own independent list of `hobbies`.




## 3 - Practical Problems
- When method B in a parent class calls method A using self.A(), and method A is overridden in a subclass, calling method B on an instance of the subclass will invoke the overridden version of method A from the subclass.

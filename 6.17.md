# 17th June - DTR Personal Update
## 1 - More K8s

### 1.1 - Control Plan
- Before:
  - Programmers need to login in to every server and mannually execute commands.
  - Programmers need to check which server's resources (cpu, memory, etc.) satisfy the application need, then we can deploy the application.
  - After locating the server, we need to mannually create and close services.
- With K8s:
  - We can execute commands on each server by executing **interfaces** provided by **API server** in K8s' control plan.
  - **Schedulers** are now responsible for checking which server's resources is adequate.
  - **Controller managers** are responsible for create and close services.
  - Additionally, all procedures above will produce some important data (states) required to store in the storage - **ETCD**.
 
### 1.2 - Worker Node
Node is where the actual work being done, which can be an actual machine or a virtual machine where multiple application services can be run on it. Services on one node will share the computing resources of this node.
- Before:
  - We need to upload code to the server
 
- With K8s:
  - We only need to package the code as container images.

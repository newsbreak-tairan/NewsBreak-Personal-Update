# 4th June - DTR Personal Update
## 1 - Go Library
1. "flag": a standard library in go, used for parsing **command-line arguments**.
   1. define flags: the package allows you to define various types of flags, such as string, integer, boolean, etc.
   2. parse flags: once the flag is defined, the `flag` package can parse command-line input and assign te values to the respective variables.
   3. use `flag.Parse()` to ensure command-line arguments can be processed correctly.
2. "gopkg.in/yaml.v2": a library parsing and serializing YAML data.
  - the package can transform Go struct to YAML data, and vice versa.
3. "gopkg.in/mgo.v2": a driver used in Go language for MongoDB, which provides a series of APIs, making developers multipulate MongoDB database.
  - `mgo.Dial(server)`: connecting to the server (database), which is a string type parameter. The method returns a `mgo.Session`, indicating the connection with MongoDB

## 2 - Struct: A Great Way to Manage Massive Data & Complicated Logics
1. Organized Data -> Clear Structure -> Good Readability
2. Modularity
3. Field Tags: by attaching tags behind fields, providing additional metadata. For instance, the `yaml` tag is used to specify the behavior of struct fields during serialization and deserialization, making the struct more flexible.
4. Convenient Access and Modification: Through the field names of the struct, you can conveniently access and modify the field values.
For instance, we can directly access or modify the value of the server address using `config.Server`.

## 3 - Module Functionality Analysis
### Upstream
#### config.go
- `func LoadConifg(conf string) (*Config, error)`: initialize an empty config struct ("../conf/dev.yaml"), returns nil if errors happen during `os.Open`.

# 4th June - DTR Personal Update
## 1 - Go Library
1. "flag": a standard library in go, used for parsing **command-line arguments**.
   1. define flags: the package allows you to define various types of flags, such as string, integer, boolean, etc.
   2. parse flags: once the flag is defined, the `flag` package can parse command-line input and assign te values to the respective variables.
   3. use `flag.Parse()` to ensure command-line arguments can be processed correctly.
2. "gopkg.in/yaml.v2": a library parsing and serializing YAML data.
  - the package can transform Go struct to YAML data, and vice versa.
3. "gopkg.in/mgo.v2": a driver used in Go language for MongoDB, which provides a series of APIs, making developers multipulate MongoDB database.
  - `mgo.Dial(server)`: connecting to the server (database), which is a string type parameter. The method returns a `mgo.Session`, indicating the connection with MongoDB
4. "sync":
   - sync.Once{} returns a struct that ensures a piece of code can **only be executed once** when the go program is running.

## 2 - Struct: A Great Way to Manage Massive Data & Complicated Logics
1. Organized Data -> Clear Structure -> Good Readability
2. Modularity
3. Field Tags: by attaching tags behind fields, providing additional metadata. For instance, the `yaml` tag is used to specify the behavior of struct fields during serialization and deserialization, making the struct more flexible.
4. Convenient Access and Modification: Through the field names of the struct, you can conveniently access and modify the field values.
For instance, we can directly access or modify the value of the server address using `config.Server`.

## 3 - Goroutines & Channels
### 3.1 - Goroutines
A Goroutine is a lightweight execution thread in the Go programming language and a function that executes **concurrently** with the rest of the program.
### 3.2 - Channels
#### 3.2.1 - Creating Channels
In Go, a channel is a data structure used for **communication & synchronization between goroutines** (for threads communication), providing a safe, simple, and efficient way to pass data between goroutines.

Channels are created using the built-in `make()` function, and keyword `chan` is used to specify that I'm creating a channel. The type of the channel is determined by the type of data being passed through it. E.g. `ch := make(chan int)`. In the example, `chan int` indicates that `ch` is a chaneel that can transmit integers. The `make()` function allocates and initializes the underlying data structure required for the channel to function.

Additionally, we can specify the direction of the channel, which **restricts the channel to only sending or receiving operations**. 
```go
// channel for send integer only
sendCh := make(chan<- int)

// channel for receiving integers only
recvCh := make(<-chan int)
```

#### 3.2.2 - Sending & Receiving Data
The `<-` operator is used to send data to a channel and to receive data from a channel. Sending & receiving operations cause both the sender & receiver to **block** on the channel until the other side is ready for the corresponding operation.
```go
// sending data to a channel
ch <- 10

// receiving data from a channel
x := <-ch
```
#### 3.2.3 - Close the Channel
Channels can be explicitly closed to signal the receiver that no more data will be sent. After closing, a channel can still receive data but **cannot send** any more data (`close()`). 

We can use multiple assignment to check if the channel has been closed. 
```go
// receiving data from a channel & assign returned values to x & ok
x, ok := <-ch
if !ok{
   // the channel is closed, x is the zero value of the channel element type
}
```

#### 3.2.4 - Non-Blocking Communication
By default, sending & receving operations are both blocking operations. Yet, we can achieve non-blocking communication through `state` statement:
```go
// select is used to wait on multiple channel operations simultanously
select {
   // listen for the succeed channel, waiting for a value from the channel
	case <-succeeded:
		glog.Info("Shutdown successfuly!!!")
		glog.Flush()
		os.Exit(0)
   // time.After function creates a channel that will send a value after the specified timeout duration
	case <-time.After(timeout):
		glog.Errorln("Shutdown timeout!!!")
		glog.Flush()
		os.Exit(1)
}
```


## 4 - Module Functionality Analysis
### main.go
#### init()
#### main()
- create a new **SpiderUpstream** call _u_ using initialized config & NewSpiderUpstream
- then **Register each Upstream struct, including ap & wholesaler** into the _upstreams_, instance variable of the newly created SpiderUpstream _u_
- start _u_
- **END OF STORY!!!**

### Upstream

#### Upstream.go (the controller)
- **Upstream** interface:
  - `Name() String`
  - `Schedule(nex chan<- *Payload)`
- SpiderUpstream struct
- `func NewSpiderUpstream(numConcurrency int, spiderAPIAddr string, deduper Depuder) *SpiderUpstream`: used to create a new SpiderUpstream struct.
- method `(u *SpiderUpstream) Register`
- method `(u *SpiderUpstream) Start`
  1. `u.schedule()`: execute all Schedule methods of all upstreams inside _u_'s _upstreams_.
  2. using keyword `go` to start a concurrent thread for `u.callSpiderAPI()`
  3. record log "start spiderupstream"
  4. wait to receive the message from u.stop
  5. record log "stop spiderupstream"

#### config.go
- `func LoadConifg(conf string) (*Config, error)`: initialize an empty config struct ("../conf/dev.yaml"), returns nil if errors happen during `os.Open`.

#### Ap.go
- define fetch source - `getAllFeedBase`
- func GetAllFeedFromAP(nextPage *string) ([]string, error): acquire (fetch) information from `getAllFeedBase`
- `(ap *AP) Schedule(next chan<- *Payload)`:
  - take a channel passing pointers of Payload struct as a parameter
  - get all urls using `GetAllFeedFromAP`
  - use each url to generate a Payload struct, **send the pointer to the Payload through the given channel**

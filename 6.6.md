## 1 - Kafka - Definition, Architecture & Terminology
### 1.1 - Kafka Definition
Kafka is the **distributed streaming platform** for building real-time piplines and streaming applications at massive scale, which is designed to solve the problem of ingesting high volumes of event data with low latency.
### 1.2 - Architecture

### 1.3 - Terminology
- Producer: a process reading data and writing them to the queue
- Consumer: downstream processes consuming data from the queue
When the queue is handled by one server, with the expand and increase of data to transport, our server will struggle to handle such heavy load. Therefore, Kafka provides a distributed solution, distributing contents of one queue to multiple ones.
- Partition: each queue is called a partition.
- Broker: a server that holds one or multiple partitions.
- Record: each item in the partition is called a record.
- Partition Key: the field used to decide which partition the record should store in.
- Topic: a group of partitions handling the same type of data.
- Offset: a identifier for each record in a partition.

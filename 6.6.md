## 1 - Kafka - Definition, Architecture & Terminology
### 1.1 - Kafka Definition
Kafka is the **distributed streaming platform** for building real-time piplines and streaming applications at massive scale, which is designed to solve the problem of ingesting high volumes of event data with low latency.
### 1.2 - Architecture
<img width="1258" alt="kafka_arch" src="https://github.com/newsbreak-tairan/NewsBreak-Personal-Update/assets/171548189/ccf8e5f1-fcc4-4ff7-833f-fc48b96960dc">
### 1.3 - Terminology

- Producer: a process reading data and writing them to the queue
- Consumer: downstream processes consuming data from the queue
When the queue is handled by one server, with the expand and increase of data to transport, our server will struggle to handle such heavy load. Therefore, Kafka provides a distributed solution, distributing contents of one queue to multiple ones.
- Partition: each queue is called a partition.
- Broker: a server that holds one or multiple partitions.
- Record: each item in the partition is called a record.
- Partition Key: the field used to decide which partition the record should store in.
- Topic: a group of partitions handling the same type of data.
- Offset: a identifier for each record in a partition.

## 2 - pymongo (TaskManager <- MongoUtil)
`pymongo` is the python official deriver to communication with MongoDB, which is a document database.

### 2.1 Overview
1. Connect to the MongoDB, which means building connection with the MongoDB server. This step does not involve the choice of specific database, which can be done using `MongoClient` class, requiring the host name & port number of the MongoDB server.
```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
```
2. Choose a database, telling the MongoDB server which database you want to perform operations on, which can be achieved using the attributes of the `MongoClient` object
```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
```
3. Choose set we want to perform operations on (like choosing which table we want for a RDBMS)
```python
collection = db['my_collection']
```
4. further operations

### 2.2 - MongDB Query Syntax

The MongoDB query syntax is very flexible and provides a rich set of operators and functionalities to meet various querying needs. Here are some commonly used MongoDB query operators and syntax:

#### Query Conditions

In MongoDB, you can use various query conditions to filter documents. Here are some commonly used query conditions:

- **Equality Condition**:

```python
filter = {'name': 'Alice'}
```

- **Range Condition**:

```python
filter = {'age': {'$gt': 30}}  # greater than 30
filter = {'age': {'$lt': 30}}  # less than 30
filter = {'age': {'$gte': 30}} # greater than or equal to 30
filter = {'age': {'$lte': 30}} # less than or equal to 30
```

- **Inclusion Condition**:

```python
filter = {'name': {'$in': ['Alice', 'Bob']}}
filter = {'name': {'$nin': ['Alice', 'Bob']}}
```

- **Fuzzy Search**:

```python
import re
filter = {'name': re.compile('^A')}  # documents with names starting with the letter "A"
```

#### Query Operators

MongoDB query syntax also supports various query operators for executing more complex queries. Here are some commonly used query operators:

- **Logical Operators**:

```python
filter = {'$and': [{'name': 'Alice'}, {'age': {'$gt': 30}}]}  # logical AND operation
filter = {'$or': [{'name': 'Alice'}, {'name': 'Bob'}]}        # logical OR operation
filter = {'$not': {'name': 'Alice'}}                           # logical NOT operation
```

- **Array Operators**:

```python
filter = {'tags': {'$all': ['python', 'mongodb']}}  # documents containing all specified elements
filter = {'tags': {'$elemMatch': {'$gte': 3}}}      # documents where array elements match specified conditions
```

- **Text Search Operators**:

```python
filter = {'$text': {'$search': 'python'}}  # full-text search
```

- **Geospatial Operators**:

```python
filter = {'location': {'$near': {'$geometry': {'type': 'Point', 'coordinates': [x, y]}}}}  # documents near a location
```

#### Query Methods

In MongoDB, common query methods include `find()`, `find_one()`, `aggregate()`, etc. These methods are used to execute queries and return matching documents.

```python
# Find all documents that match the condition
docs = collection.find(filter)

# Find the first document that matches the condition
doc = collection.find_one(filter)

# Aggregate query
pipeline = [{'$match': filter}]
result = collection.aggregate(pipeline)
```
